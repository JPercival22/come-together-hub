<p>
  Approached by an organisation to update their exiating website from a shoddy "make your own website" company, it wasnt great. It didnt represent the organisation as a great charity that was helping the most vulnerable, or the homeless and was not responsive.
  
  <h2>Stage 1</h2>
  <p>Designed using Figma, tested on over 100 users from different backgrounds and abilities and developed using semantic HTML5, SCSS, CSS3, Vanila Javascript and deployed as Version 1. The aim for this release was to see how the company would cope with donations, if there was an actual need for a login page to make regular donations to the charity and if the users would want this feature too.
  </p>
  <h2Stage 2</h2>
  <p>The designs for the login, donations and payment sections are completed. The code has been preapred for this eventuality and a framework selected which is React once UX Testing is complete. </p>
